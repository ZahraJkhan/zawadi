# Welcome to ZAWADI

<p>This app allows users to store memories from their baby's early years. There is also a social media component where users can share and comment on stories.</p>
## Overview:
 * React Front-End: We'll use React to build the user interface (UI). The app will have a header, navigation bar, sections for adding child profiles, tracking milestones, uploading media, and more.
 * Node.js Backend (Express): Weâ€™ll use Express.js to handle the API requests, handle user authentication, send email reminders, store data in MongoDB, and generate PDFs.
 * MongoDB: Use of MongoDB to store user profiles, child profiles, milestones, and media.
 * User authentication with login/logout functionality
 * Sending email reminders for appointments, milestones
 * Uploading media (photos/videos)
 * Generating PDF for child profiles
 * Deployment to a hosting platform

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
